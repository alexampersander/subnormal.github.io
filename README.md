===================

This is my new attempt at a clean, fresh looking website. Flat design rocks!

## Todo:
* ~~Add landing animation~~
* Add content
* ~~URGENT: Redo the animation in CSS. Seriously, it's embarassing.~~
* Make the new CSS animation work in Firefox. At the moment, I can't see why FF doesn't like my page :(
